# EDA-NETFLIX

# Overview

In this project, we will delve into the world of data analysis by exploring and analyzing a
challenging open-source Kaggle dataset. The goal of this project is to showcase the process of
loading, cleaning, exploring, and analyzing data using pandas with a more challenging dataset.

# Project setup
- [x] Data Acquisition:
Download the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows )
and save it to a local directory. Import the necessary libraries, including pandas, numpy, and
matplotlib.
- [x] Data Loading:
Use pandas to read the dataset file (e.g., CSV, Excel) into a pandas DataFrame.
Explore the structure of the DataFrame by examining the column names, data types, and initial
rows.
- [x] Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Identify columns with missing values
Handle duplicate data: Identify and remove any duplicate rows from the dataset.
- [x] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct preliminary data exploration to gain insights into the dataset.
Generate summary statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
Visualize the data using plots and charts to identify patterns and relationships.
- [x] Data Analysis:
Formulate questions to guide the analysis.
Apply pandas functions and methods to filter, group, aggregate, and transform the data.
Extract meaningful insights and draw conclusions from the analysis.
- [x] Visualization:
Utilize matplotlib or other visualization libraries to create informative and visually appealing
plots.
Generate visualizations to support the findings and present them in a clear and concise manner.
- [x] Conclusion:
Summarize the key findings and insights obtained from the data analysis.
Reflect on the challenges encountered during the analysis and discuss strategies to overcome
them.
Suggest further research directions or propose additional analyses based on the dataset.
